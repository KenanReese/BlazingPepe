     How it works - 

​​

Trading Fees: When users trade against the liquidity pool, all holders receive 4% of all traded volume through a mechanism called Buy&Burn actively injecting liquidity on every trade. These fees are proportional to all holders. When tokens are truly destroyed supply decreases, returning the paired value to all other tokens in supply. This contributes to equal distribution of value returned to the ecosystem.

Constant Proportion Market Maker (CPMM) Mechanism: Uniswap and similar automated market makers use a CPMM mechanism, which ensures that the product of the token balances remains constant. This creates trading volume through out the various pools and returns extra trade value to the community.
This Means that the more price movement the more bot transactions, resulting in more tokens being burned and taxes paid to the ecosystem. 

Simple but affective for both the holder and day traders, Happy Blazing!
